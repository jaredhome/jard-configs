is a text-based idle/incremental game filled with content to discover and explore. Wake up on a hostile planet with no memory, trap your first Trimp, and send it to battle. Breed your Trimps, set them to work, house them, gear them up with the best equipment, and keep sending them to battle!\r\n\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Nearly 7 years of updates so far\r\n[*]Over 50 different Challenges that tweak the Universe in different ways\r\n[*]Nearly 400 achievements that make you stronger\r\n[*]Hundreds of perks, talents, and upgrades\r\n[*]Trimploads of automation, with detailed levels of customization. Trimps is all about unlocking new stuff and automating old stuff.\r\n[*]Brand new tutorial! After researching your first point of Science, ADVISOR will help guide you along your first adventure to the mysterious Portal.\r\n[*]Two different Universes to explore, mini games, a &quot;pet&quot; to level up, and so much more\r\n[*]Trimps has always had a web version without a cash shop, and has never been balanced around expecting anyone to buy premium currency (Bones). You will earn more than enough Bones through normal play to purchase all upgrades way before running out of game content, there are even some talents mid-game that increase Bone drops. You can purchase Bones in this version to support development, but think of it as a pay-what-you-want system for the game rather than something you need to buy to enjoy Trimps.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nTrimps has been around as a web game since 2015, and still receives multiple updates per year that add new content. The game has been developed since the beginning by one person, but with the help of an active and healthy community on Reddit and Discord that's never had any shortage of suggestions and ideas to implement. \r\n\r\nTaking so many suggestions and working so closely with the community for so many years has led to a game with tons of quality of life features, interesting balance, and unique ideas. Trimps is also free to play and only a 300MB download... give it a try!","strSnippet":"A text-based incremental idle game with a ridiculous amount of unique content. Automate old stuff as you unlock new stuff to keep things interesting for hours and hours, no spam clicking necessary! Trimps is everything you love about your favorite games, distilled to their purest form."}}]]
