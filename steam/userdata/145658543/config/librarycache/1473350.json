Irrelevant question — when struck, it outputs shards, and shards are amazing. They allow you to purchase and upgrade gnorps, and build new structures. The gnorps must have them. Hitting the rock is only half the battle, however, as the gnorps must retrieve the shards before they can use them. \r\n\r\n[img]https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1473350/extras/rs2.gif?t=1712033498[/img]\r\n\r\n[b]Acquire and upgrade gnorps[/b]\r\nGnorps represent the heart of the game. They are responsible for both shard generation and collection. Gnorps adapt varying methodologies to reach their goal. Some slam the rock with their heads, others shoot it with arrows and guns. You have gnorps that grow flowers, and gnorps that use psychic powers. They even build rockets and drones. All for a single purpose — the accumulation of shards.  \r\n\r\n[img]https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1473350/extras/mountaineer.gif?t=1712033498[/img]\r\n\r\n[b]A strategic incremental [/b]\r\n(the) Gnorp Apologue is about making numbers goes up, but how you do that is up to you.
